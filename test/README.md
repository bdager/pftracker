The paper_results.py file get the pftracker framework for getting A Python 
Framework for Face Tracking based on Particle Filter (PF) paper results.

You can obtain the same results throught the PF graphical interface.

Keep in mind that the resulting trajectory of the PF algorithms can vary 
in each run as a result of the addition of random noise in the tracking 
process. So, results should similars but not necessarily the same.
